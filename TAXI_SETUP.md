# Taxi Booking Form Setup

## Google Maps API Configuration

The taxi booking form now includes a **complete Google Maps integration** with both autocomplete suggestions and interactive map selection.

### ‚úÖ Features Implemented

#### **1. Real Google Maps Integration**
- **Google Places Autocomplete**: Real-time location suggestions using Google Places API
- **Interactive Map Selection**: Click the map icon to open a modal with an embedded Google Map
- **Click-to-Select**: Click anywhere on the map to place a marker and select that location
- **Geocoding**: Automatically converts map coordinates to readable addresses

#### **2. Fallback System**
- **Smart Fallback**: If Google Maps API is not loaded, automatically falls back to mock data
- **Seamless Experience**: Users won't notice any difference in functionality
- **Mock Data**: Includes popular Delhi locations for testing

### üöÄ Setup Instructions

#### **Step 1: Get Google Maps API Key**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the following APIs:
   - **Places API** (for autocomplete suggestions)
   - **Geocoding API** (for address conversion)
   - **Maps JavaScript API** (for interactive map)

#### **Step 2: Configure Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:
```bash
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_google_maps_api_key_here
```

#### **Step 3: API Key Security**
- Restrict your API key to your domain in Google Cloud Console
- Never commit your actual API key to version control
- Use environment variables for all API keys

### üéØ How It Works

1. **Type in Location Field**: 
   - Start typing (minimum 2 characters)
   - Real-time suggestions appear from Google Places API
   - Click any suggestion to select it

2. **Use Map Selection**:
   - Click the map icon (üó∫Ô∏è) next to the location field
   - Interactive Google Map opens in a modal
   - Click anywhere on the map to place a marker
   - Click "Confirm Location" to select that point
   - Address is automatically converted from coordinates

3. **Fallback Mode**:
   - If Google Maps API is not available, mock data is used

## Usage

The taxi booking form is now integrated into the `TexiHome` component and can be accessed through the taxi section of your application.

## API Integration

The form is ready to be connected to your backend API. The `handleFindRide` function currently logs the booking data to the console. You can modify this function to send the data to your backend endpoint.

Example booking data structure:
```javascript
{
  tripType: 'round-trip',
  pickupLocation: 'Connaught Place, New Delhi, Delhi, India',
  dropLocation: 'Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi, Delhi, India',
  vehicleType: 'sedan',
  pickDate: '2024-01-15',
  pickTime: '10:30',
  dropDate: '2024-01-15',
  dropTime: '12:00',
  duration: '2 Hours'
}
```
